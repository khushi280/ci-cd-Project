# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Software Development

This project sets up a **CI/CD pipeline** to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications. By integrating powerful tools and services, this pipeline streamlines software development by automating repetitive tasks, increasing deployment frequency, and enhancing software quality.

## 📋 Overview

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is a set of automated processes used to build, test, and deploy applications. The pipeline integrates multiple stages to handle the software development lifecycle efficiently, ensuring that code changes are validated and deployed consistently and reliably.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Automated Code Compilation**: Automatically compiles the code whenever new changes are pushed.
- **Testing and Code Quality Analysis**: Runs unit tests and performs static code analysis to ensure code quality and security.
- **Artifact Management**: Manages and stores build artifacts, making them available for deployment.
- **Containerization**: Packages applications in containers for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Deployment to Kubernetes**: Deploys applications to Kubernetes, providing a scalable and robust production environment.
- **Monitoring**: Integrates monitoring tools to track application performance and health.

## 🛠️ Tools Used in the Pipeline

1. **GitHub** 🟦: Version control system used for managing source code. The project uses a private repository to store and track code changes.
2. **Docker** 🐳: Containerization tool that packages applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.
3. **SonarQube** 📊: A code quality analysis tool that scans the codebase for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells, ensuring high-quality code standards.
4. **Jenkins** 🤖: Automation server used to orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline, managing the entire build, test, and deployment process.
5. **Maven** ☕: A build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It handles project builds, dependencies, and documentation.
6. **Nexus** 📦: Artifact repository manager that stores and manages build artifacts, such as JAR files, Docker images, and other dependencies.
7. **Prometheus and Grafana** 📉: Monitoring tools used to collect and visualize metrics from the deployed application, helping in identifying performance issues.
8. **Kubernetes** 🧊: An open-source container orchestration platform that manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.

## 📦 Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Code Management (SCM)**
   - The source code is hosted in a private GitHub repository.
   - Code changes are tracked, and branches are used for feature development and testing.

2. **Build**
   - Jenkins triggers the build process using Maven whenever code changes are detected in the repository.
   - Maven compiles the code, resolves dependencies, and packages the application.

3. **Code Analysis**
   - The pipeline runs static code analysis using SonarQube to check for code quality, security vulnerabilities, and coding standards.

4. **Testing**
   - Unit and integration tests are executed to validate the functionality of the application.
   - Test reports are generated and stored for review.

5. **Artifact Management**
   - Build artifacts, such as JAR files and Docker images, are stored in Nexus.
   - Versioned artifacts ensure that the correct version is deployed at each stage.

6. **Containerization**
   - The application is containerized using Docker, creating a consistent runtime environment for deployment.

7. **Deployment to Kubernetes**
   - Jenkins deploys the Docker containers to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and availability of the application.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Prometheus collects metrics from the application and infrastructure.
   - Grafana visualizes these metrics, providing real-time insights into application performance and health.
